Shane's Search Engine
----------------------------------------

The aim of this project was to create a search engine for text files where the
user can input search terms and the program will display how many matches there
are for those search terms in each file.

The program can be used to search single terms seperated by a comma or a single
term by itself. It will return a list of how many matches for these term(s) were
contained within each file searched.

I have also implemented a way for the user to be able to choose the search space.
